* Goal
Get everything to the top floor

* Rules
Microchips can be around other microchips
Generators can be around other generators
Microchips can't be around generators unless connected to THEIR generator
The elevator can carry one or two generators or microchips
The elevator stops on each floor 

* Thinking racket-y 
** Represent items like this
[:mc, "X"]  Microchip of type X
[:g, "X"]   Generator of type X
[:e]        Elevator

** Represent building state like this
[[items on floor 1], [items on floor 2]...]

** Moves are represented like this
[cargo, starting floor, ending floor]

** Solve function
Takes 
- current state
- goal state
- list of moves made

Does
- See if we're done
- Calculates the list of possible moves
- RECURSION

*** Calculating the list of possible moves
Figure out where the elevator is.

Take all items on that floor 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 if possible and move them up or down one floor.
If the new configuration is valid (and novel) recurse
